 abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

	Abstract = {Life table methods are developed for populations whose members differ in their endowment for longevity. Unlike standard methods, which ignore such heterogeneity, these methods use different calculations to construct cohort, period, and individual life tables. The results imply that standard methods overestimate current life expectancy and potential gains in life expectancy from health and safety interventions, while underestimating rates of individual aging, past progress in reducing mortality, and mortality differentials between pairs of populations. Calculations based on Swedish mortality data suggest that these errors may be important, especially in old age.},

 abstract = {The use of regression models for making covariance adjustments in the comparsion of survival curves is illustrated by application to a clinical trial of maintenance therapy for childhood leukemia. Three models are considered: the log linear exponential (Glasser [1967]); Cox's [1972] nonparametric generalization of this; and the linear exponential (Feigl and Zelen [1965]). Age and white blood count at diagnosis are both shown to be important for prognosis; adjustment for the latter variable has marked effects on the treatment comparisons. Both advantages and disadvantages with the regression approach are noted.},

abstract = {Abstract.  Bayesian analysis of time-to-event data, usually called survival analysis, has received increasing attention in the last years. In Cox-type models it allows to use information from the full likelihood instead of from a partial likelihood, so that the baseline hazard function and the model parameters can be jointly estimated. In general, Bayesian methods permit a full and exact posterior inference for any parameter or predictive quantity of interest. On the other side, Bayesian inference often relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques which, from the user point of view, may appear slow at delivering answers. In this article, we show how a new inferential tool named integrated nested Laplace approximations can be adapted and applied to many survival models making Bayesian analysis both fast and accurate without having to rely on MCMC-based inference.},

 abstract = {In studies of survival, the hazard function for each individual may depend on observed risk variables but usually not all such variables are known or measurable. This unknown factor of the hazard function is usually termed the individual heterogeneity or frailty. When survival is time to the occurrence of a particular type of event and more than one such time may be obtained for each individual, frailty is a common factor among such recurrence times. A model including frailty is fitted to such repeated measures of recurrence times.},

abstract = "Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are modeled and examined for spatial structure using different spatial models."
